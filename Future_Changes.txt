Things to fix
    1. Clean up css maybe done
    2. Good comments / Make sure the design is intuitive and good / Rename variables and functions to make sense maybe add malanywhere before everything
    3. Write documentation for the api and chrome extension
    4. Add the advanced button mal uses it fill up space and looks good
    5. If an ajax fails send info to the front end to be displayed.
    7. Should there be a tag or different buttons to denote if the anime is actually on the users list
    8. Public release?
    10. Send a JSON or XML file from the backend because whoever uses the api very well may not be writing in Javascript
    11. Fix Permissions on Chrome Extension
