Things to fix
    1. Code -3 and -1 are similar maybe combine and -1 is just a special case of -3
    2. More error checking, if getting credentials from chrome fails users should not be able to edit them
    3. Forgot username forgot password and sign up should only show if the user isn't signed in
    2. Line 76 malotg-page what if the add fails same thing for delete farther down
    4. Add the advanced button mal uses it fill up space and looks good
    6. Public release?
    7. Send a JSON or XML file from the backend because whoever uses the api very well may not be writing in Javascript
