Things to fix
    1. Change html fields from malotg -> malanywhere
    2. Rename set status to something that makes more sense, as it also controls logging in
    3. rename localUser and localPassword it dose'nt really make sense
    4. Good comments/ Make sure the design is intuitive and good / Rename variables and functions to make sense maybe add malanywhere before everything
    5. Add autoupdate functionality
    6. Clean up css
