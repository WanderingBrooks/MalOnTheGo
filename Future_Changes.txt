Things to fix
    1. Add the advanced button mal uses it fill up space and looks good
    2. Should there be a tag or different buttons to denote if the anime is actually on the users list
    3. Clean up css maybe done
    4. Good comments / Make sure the design is intuitive and good / Rename variables and functions to make sense maybe add malanywhere before everything
    5. Write documentation for the api and chrome extension
    6. Public release?


Things to note:
    the request is passed to every function that the user has to define so if they need extra info passed
    in the object thy can access it wherever they neeed it. An example where its useful si chrome.tabs.query to find the right tab
    I need the URL so I pass that in the request object to be accessed later.
