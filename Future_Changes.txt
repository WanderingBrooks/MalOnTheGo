Things to fix
    1. Clean up css maybe done
    2. Good comments / Make sure the design is intuitive and good / Rename variables and functions to make sense maybe add malanywhere before everything
    3. Write documentation for the api and chrome extension
    4. Add the advanced button mal uses it fill up space and looks good
    5. If an ajax fails send info to the front end to be displayed.
    6. Move Advanced options to the set status instead of passing it to the back end Almost works
       Problem is that when going to hte back end it seems variables are deleted or uninitialized
    7. Should there be a tag or different buttons to denote if the anime is actually on the users list
    8. Public release?


Things to note:
    the request is passed to every function that the user has to define so if they need extra info passed
    in the object thy can access it wherever they need it. An example where its useful si chrome.tabs.query to find the right tab
    I need the URL so I pass that in the request object to be accessed later.

Code Table
    -2: Insert Login hide everything else
    -1: Insert Error show not found
     0: Anime found but user does not have it on their list
     1: Anime is on Mal and the user has values already stored
