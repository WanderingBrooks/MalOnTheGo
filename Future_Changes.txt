Things to fix
    1. Are there changes if so save them before going to mal That works but if you save I should update the current status by making
        it a "global variable" in the ui controller
    2. Change html fields from malotg -> malanywhere
    3. Rename set status to something that makes more sense, as it also controls logging in
    4. rename localUser and localPassword it dose'nt really make sense
    5. Good comments/ Make sure the design is intuitive and good / Rename variables and functions to make sense maybe add malanywhere before everything
    6. Add autoupdate functionality
    7. Clean up css



Code Table
    -2: Insert Login hide everything else
    -1: Insert Error show not found
     0: Anime found but user does not have it on their list
     1: Anime is on Mal and the user has values already stored
