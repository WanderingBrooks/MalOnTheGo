Things to fix
    1. Are there changes if so save them before going to mal
    2. Move options page to be loaded on the page and not in the chrome exstension
    3. Change html fields from malotg -> malanywhere
    4. Rename set status to something that makes more sense, as it also controls logging in
    5. Where should inject login be? and how should the callback for getting credentials work
    6. Only time I need to reinitalize everything is if the user changes their credentials, I save them nad then I call the function that initliazes everything when the page loads,
       Then check if the div has already been created and if it has
    7. Something should change with getCrednetialsAndSend it dosent seem that well designed now we only get crednetials once

Code Table
    -2: Insert Login
    -1: Insert Error show not found
     0: Anime found but user does not have it on their list
     1: Anime is on Mal and the user has values already stored

Problem here I Also want the user to be able to see their credentials, If its either or loaded, should both be loaded and and one be hidden?
