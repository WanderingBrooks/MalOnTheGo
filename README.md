For information on how to implement the malanywhere api see the JavaScript file [malotg-controller.js](https://github.com/WanderingBrooks/MalOnTheGo/blob/master/JavaScript/malotg-controller.js). Theres a lot of code related to chrome that can be ignored the lines that call the api are 31 and 48. 

MalOTG is a Chrome Exstension that adds the ability to edit a users myanimelist values for the current show they are watching on crunchyroll.com. This is done using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, jQuery, the Myanimelist api and Chromes apis. The chrome exstension is currently in a private beta but has an expected public release of March 2017. 

Current Issues:
  Errors from the Chrome apis or the Myanimelist apis are handeled but not optimally.
